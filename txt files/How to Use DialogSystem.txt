CharacterData / CharacterResource
You can set character's name font settings,
and character portrait via a sprite atlas (not working)
However you have to preload the resources into
DialogSystemManager's characterDataDict

CommandListener
singleton, can listen to cmds in command boxes and execute them

DialogSystemManager
singleton, 
data, holds variables used in conversation and command boxes, any data
created from a conversation will be store here
focusedSystem, only a focused system can be interacted, only one system is allowed to be focused
 
DialogSystem
can take one conversation, you should use multiple instances for different conversation.

SpeechBox
this is where the text from DialogSystem will be displayed on
can be changed into either UI or world space

Conversation
a txt file to be parsed into a DialogSystem

Flags
--<Flag>--
flag remembers the position of the line in a conversation, using "jump:" command, you can either skip or 
go back to that specified position

Command Boxes
(BoxA) <text> (BoxB)
there are 2 command boxes, command in "BoxA" is executed before the text. 
However "BoxA" only takes in a Condition Container with one step, also an instruction
Instruction is called when "BoxA" condition is false
IMPORTANT () EMPTY BOXA IS TRUTHY, SO FOR EXAMPLE: ">(hide:)"
IN THE EXAMPLE, THE BUTTON INSTRUCTION IS "hide:" WHICH HIDES THE CHOICE BUTTON
BECAUSE THERE ARE CONTENTS IN BOXA, BOXA CONDITION IS FALSE, THE BUTTON WILL BE
HIDDEN

Dialog Lines
(<condition>? <instruction>) <Name> : <dialog> [<BBTag>] (<command>)
if the condition is false the rest of the line will be ignored by default, 
any other commands in BoxB will also be ignored, 
only the first step is counted, and the "if:" command ID is not nessasary
BBCode is supported, using rich text label.
<Name> = can determine the character portraits, unique font color, displayed before the dialog
<dialog> = dialog to be displayed
format = you can use placeholder example,
"{name}: My name is {name}, nice to meet you." if global data has {name} included, it will replace the name, 
int and bool are also casted to string
<[BBTag]> apply BBCode to the dialog, also allows parameters override, if multiple tags are inputted split them using ","
"" default = if condition is false, the text and command boxB will be skipped over

Stamps
*<speed>D<delay>*
<speed> = have a new reading speed 
<delay> = add a delay before playing
within the dialog you can place a stamp, this will determine the read speed and delay of the following text.
for example:
Time is ticking*5*... *0D1.5*BOOM
In the example there are 2 stamps, stamp1 = *5*, stamp2 = *0D1.5*
The text will play normally until it reaches a stamp. In stamp1, it changes the speed to 5.
In stamp2, it changes the read speed to 0, which will be instant, and delayed by 1.5 seconds

Choices
> (BoxA) <text> (BoxB)
> (<condition> ? <instruction>) <text> (<command>)
choices are defined by ">" at the start of the line
you can apply an optional instruction in a choice's BoxA
<text> = text displayed on buttons
<instruction>
"" = default, the button will be disabled but visible
"disabled:" = does the same as default, the button will be disabled but visible
"hide:" = this will stop the creation of the button #Todo use "Skip:"

condition container
<if:|elif:> <sub-conditionA> <and|or> <sub-conditionB> ? <command chain>;
<else:> <command chain>
Sub-condiiton = <%subject> <comparator> <object>
if: = declare start of the command
<%subject> = must use "%"prefix to tell complier to get global dictionary, 
	if subject doesn't exist, create one
<comparator> = (==|!=|<|<=|>|>=) "==" and "!=" is universal, the rest are for int
<object> = used for comparison
<and|or> = optional, includes a 2nd Sub-condition, "and" checks for both sub-conditions are true, "or" checks for either sub-conditions is true
<command> = another command that can be run if the condition is true
<?> end of condition check
<;> end of current current step, and start of a new step
elif: = if "if:" has failed check this condition
else: = do no take in a condiiton run when all other condition b4 failed, run this
ie:
(if: %a == 0 ? then: %b += 1 ; elif: %a == 1 ? then: %b -= 1 ; else: %b = 1)
steps are seperated by ";", this tells the compiler to move on to the next condition
if the previous condition has failed, without it, 
the step will only read the first condition
NOTE:
usage of "if:" and "elif:" doesn't matter, they are treated the as same, 
however "if:" is required to be at the start to be considered a valid container. 
If you used 2 "if:" and both condition are true, 
only the first "if:" will be called, as the loop has already exited.

assignment command 
#was called then command b4, some comments might still use the old name
then: <target> <operator> <value>
<target> = get global dictionary, if target doesn't exist, create one
<operator> = (=|!=|+=|-=|*=|/=|%=|prefix|suffix|prefix_|_suffix)
"prefix" and "suffix" are for strings, they add either prefix or suffix
"prefix_" and "_suffix" add prefix or suffix with a single empty space" "between
<value> = update the target to that of the value
ie:
(then: %monsterIsAlive is false)
ie:
(then: %monsterHP -= 5)
ie:
(then: %toggle != %toggle)
"!=" is only implemented for toggle usage without the need for condition container
IMPORTANT, DECIMALS ARE NOT SUPPORTED IN THIS COMMAND

jump command
jump: ID=<dsid> FLAG=<flag>
jump to the specified flag, "-"
flag "beginning" will return to the beginning of the conversation, 
unless it is overidden


emotion command #todo
<emotion: <name> <emotion>
changes portrait sprite to the correct via dictionary in a character resource
can be used to display character portrait without a name in dialog, or override
the current portrait

Command chain #THIS MIGHT BE REMOVE IN THE FUTURE
command chain is seperated by ";" in a condition container
use "," to seperate if the chain is not contained in a condition check
this is useful when a single condition check is true and
multiple commands needs to be executed.
ie:
>buy potion (if: money >= 10 then: money -= 10 jump: flag_Buy ; else: then: backruptcy is true jump: flag_Broke)
in this example, there are 2 command chain, both having a "then:" and "jump:" command.
ie:
(if a is true then: a is false, then: b is true)
in this example, there are 2 command chain, 1st chain is part of a condition container, 
2nd chain is outside of the condition container, seperated by ",". 2nd chain will always
executed, since it's not contained in a condition container
quirks 
"then:" will be executed in order.
"jump:" is always executed last, only the first "jump:" will be executed

custom command
if your needs are more specific, you can create your own in "CommandListener.gd"
try always add ":" to the end of your command ID, this prevents potential error
when there are variables with the same name
ie:
"custom:"

important:
ONLY NAME VARIABLES WITH LETTERS AND "_" ALWAYS PREFIX IT WITH "%", 
THIS IS TO PREVENT COMMANDLISTENER TO CONFUSE IT WITH INTERGER OR OTHER KEYWORDS
Everything is case-sensitive, to avoid confusion, 
all the command inputs should be in lower-case,
except when you name variables
you don't have to create variables first, if the variable doesn't exist, 
"DialogSystemManager" will create one automatically, depending on the operator or comparator, 
the default value will either be "0", "false" or ""
There is only 3 types of Variable you can create dynamically via command, 
and are currently supported, int, bool, string.
